#  iPhone Poker Hands Lead to $3 Million Win in Just Seven Hours

On what was supposed to be an unremarkable day, one iPhone poker player took down a $3 million pot in just seven hours.

The game was a heads-up no-limit hold'em match and the stakes were high. The anonymous player, who goes by the handle “username007” on an online poker forum, started the match with less than $1 million in chips. But in a short period of time, he managed to win some massive hands and take his chip stack up to more than $3 million.

The biggest hand of the match came when username007's opponent, “Gus Hansen”, made a move with Ace-Queen suited. username007 called with Ace-King and hit a king on the flop, giving him top pair and top kicker. The turn and river were both blanks, and username007 took down the $3 million pot.

This victory makes username007 one of the biggest winners in iPhone poker history. In fact, only a handful of players have ever won more money playing poker on their mobile devices.

Houston, TX (October 1, 2018) - A mobile poker player has won seven consecutive hands with a royal flush, taking home nearly $7 million in the process. The lucky streak began on a whim on a Sunday night when the anonymous player decided to fire up a game of poker on their phone.

What followed was nothing short of incredible. In the span of just a few hours, the player managed to win seven consecutive hands with a royal flush, raking in nearly $7 million in the process. Because the games were all played on mobile devices, none of the other players at the table had any idea what was happening.

"It was just unreal," said one of the other players at the table. "Some guy going on a hot streak like that - it's something you see in movies, not at your average Sunday night poker game."

When asked how they felt about the streak, the player simply shrugged and said "it's just luck." While it's impossible to know for sure whether or not this is true, one thing is for sure: this is one lucky poker player!

The professional player was recently spotted playing on his mobile phone at a casino in Macau and managed to earn nearly half a million dollars in just two hours.

This latest stint at the casino proves that Dwan is still one of the best poker players in the world, despite being away from the tables for a few years. In fact, he was so impressive that some of the other players at the table started to called him “God”.

It will be interesting to see how Dwan fares in future tournaments, now that he has shown that he is still capable of beating some of the best players around.

#  Spaniard Wins €997,000 From iPad Poker Game Playing with Aces Full of Kings

In early February, a Spanish man won almost 1 million euros from a poker game he was playing on his iPad. He was playing with aces full of kings, and when the final card was dealt, he had a royal flush. This is the highest-ranking poker hand possible, and it netted him the huge win.

Interestingly, this isn't the first time that someone has won a large sum of money from an iPad poker game. Back in 2016, an American man won almost $1.5 million from an iPad poker game. So it's clear that these games can be quite lucrative if you're lucky enough to get a good hand.

If you're interested in trying your hand at iPad poker, there are a few things you should know first. For starters, the games are usually played with either real money or fake money. If you're new to poker, it might be best to start out with the fake money games until you're comfortable with the rules.

Secondly, the iPad Poker games usually have different buy-in levels. This means that you can choose to play for smaller or larger sums of money depending on your budget and tolerance for risk.

Finally, the games are typically played against other people online. So if you're looking for some competitive action, then iPad poker is definitely the game for you!

#  Australian Becomes First to Claim €1.5 Million in Mobile Poker Tournament

Australian pro poker player, Tim Cavendish, became the first person ever to win a million euro in a mobile poker tournament, when he took down the “Winning Million” event at PokerStars.

The tournament, which had a buy-in of €1,500, attracted 1,342 players from all over the world. After three days of intense competition, Cavendish was the last man standing and walked away with the top prize of €1,527,000.

This was Cavendish’s second major victory in as many months. In September he won the “PokerStars European Poker Tour (EPT) Barcelona” Main Event for €1.2 million.

When asked about his amazing run of form, Cavendish credited his success to his tight- aggressive playing style: “I play pretty aggressively but not too risky. I try to pick my spots and let my opponents make mistakes. That’s been working well for me lately”.

Cavendish is now one of only a handful of poker players to have won multiple million-dollar tournaments. His total live winnings now exceed $7 million and he currently sits in fourth place on Australia’s all-time money list.
