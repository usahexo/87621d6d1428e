#  Terre Haute Casino To Be Built On Former Nike Site

After nearly two years of planning, the Terre Haute casino has been given the green light to begin construction. The project, which was first announced in February of 2017, will be built on a former Nike site just east of the city.

The casino is expected to create hundreds of jobs in the area and bring in millions of dollars in revenue each year. It will be operated by Las Vegas-based Pinnacle Entertainment, which also operates casinos in Indiana, Missouri, Louisiana, and Iowa.

Pinnacle Entertainment CEO Anthony Sanfilippo said that the company is excited to be bringing its world-class entertainment and gaming experience to Terre Haute. “We know that this casino will be a huge asset to the community, creating jobs and generating much-needed revenue for local businesses and organizations.”

The casino will feature over 1,000 slot machines, 31 table games, a hotel with 250 rooms, and several restaurants and bars. It is expected to open in late 2020.

#  Terre Haute Casino Gets Final Approval, Construction Starts Soon

The Terre Haute casino is one step closer to becoming a reality as it has received the final approval from the Indiana Gaming Commission. Construction is expected to start very soon.

This $112 million project is expected to create more than 400 jobs, and it will bring in much-needed revenue to the city of Terre Haute. The location for the casino has not been announced yet, but it is likely that it will be built near the east side of town.

There has been some controversy surrounding this project, as some people feel that the money would be better spent on other things, such as schools or infrastructure improvements. However, others feel that the casino will bring much-needed jobs and revenue to the area.

The casino is expected to open in late 2019 or early 2020.
