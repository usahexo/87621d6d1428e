#  Online Gambling Sites Continue to Face Lawsuits

Online gambling sites continue to face lawsuits on a regular basis. The companies continue to operate in a murky legal area, as different countries have different laws governing online gambling. This has led to a number of lawsuits being filed by players who feel that they have not been treated fairly by the casinos, or who have lost money because of fraudulent activity on the part of the casino.

Many of these lawsuits are filed in the United States, where online gambling is technically illegal. However, there is a large and growing industry of legal online gambling in the country, as states have begun to license and regulate certain types of gambling. This has led to something of a legal gray area for online casinos, which continue to face lawsuits from players who feel that they have been wronged in some way.

One recent example is a lawsuit filed against Bovada Casino by a player named John Doe. In this case, Doe alleges that he was scammed by the casino out of $140,000. He claims that the casino refused to pay him his winnings after he had made several successful bets. Bovada Casino has denied any wrongdoing and is contesting the lawsuit.

Another recent case involved iNetBet Casino, which was sued by a player named Paul Ducharme. Ducharme alleged that the casino refused to pay him his winnings after he had made several successful bets. The casino argued that Ducharme had breached its terms and conditions, but a court ruled in favor of Ducharme and ordered the casino to pay him $35,000 in damages.

These are just two examples of the many lawsuits that online gambling sites face on a regular basis. The legal landscape for these companies is constantly changing, as different countries pass new laws governing internet gambling. Online casinos will likely continue to face lawsuits from players who feel that they have been wronged in some way.

#  Atlantic City Casinos Sue Delaware Over Online Gambling

Atlantic City casinos are suing the state of Delaware over its online gambling operations, claiming that they are unconstitutional. The casinos argue that Delaware is stealing their customers, and they are seeking damages in the amount of $9 million.

This is not the first time that the issue of online gambling has come up in court. In 2012, New Jersey unsuccessfully sued Delaware over its online gambling operations. At that time, the judge ruled that Delaware was not violating New Jersey's rights, as the two states have different legal frameworks for gambling.

Delaware's online gambling industry has been a success, with revenues of over $1 million in its first year of operation. This has come at a cost to Atlantic City casinos, which have seen their revenues decline as a result of competition from Delaware.

The lawsuit is likely to be difficult for the casinos to win. The legal argument will be based on the assertion that Delaware is violating the Commerce Clause of the Constitution by taking business away from Atlantic City casinos. However, this clause has traditionally been interpreted narrowly, and it is not clear that it applies to online gambling.

Even if the casinos are successful in their lawsuit, it is unlikely that they will be able to recover all of their lost revenues. While online gambling is a growing industry, it is still relatively small compared to traditional forms of gambling.

#  NY Times: The Casino Companies That Own America

In the early morning hours of October 6, 2014, a bus pulled up to the neoclassical façade of the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and discharged its cargo of gamblers. The casino, which had been hemorrhaging money for years, was now under new ownership: Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor.

Icahn is one of a handful of entrepreneurs who have come to dominate the casino industry in America. Though their businesses are often maligned as purveyors of vice, they have quietly become some of the most powerful players in our economy.

Collectively, the six casino companies that own America’s gaming resorts — Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts International, Penn National Gaming, Boyd Gaming, Pinnacle Entertainment and Tropicana Entertainment — reported more than $19 billion in revenue last year. They employed nearly 200,000 people and paid out more than $8 billion in wages.

To understand how this came to be, we need to go back to 1978, when New Jersey became the first state to legalize gambling on casino games like blackjack and poker. That opened the door for similar moves by other states and created a $40-billion-a-year industry.

The industry’s growth was initially slow but accelerated in the late 1990s after Congress allowed casinos on Indian reservations and then eliminated a legal prohibition against online gambling. The sector has continued to grow even as many other retail industries have shrunk.

What has made casinos so successful? In part it is because they have been able to tap into two powerful trends: Americans’ growing appetite for entertainment and our increasing tendency to gamble.

But casinos have also prospered because they are extraordinarily effective at extracting profits from their customers. In fact, they are among the most profitable businesses in America. Last year, their pretax profit margins averaged nearly 30 percent, according to Moody’s Investors Service. That is more than twice as high as those of airlines or drugstores and six times those of restaurants.
