#  NHL Playoffs Betting: What Does -135 Mean?

Understanding NHL betting odds is essential to making successful wagers. In this article, we'll break down the meaning of the three most common types of NHL odds: -105, -125, and -135.

The first type of NHL betting odds we'll discuss is -105. This is also referred to as "American Odds" and means that you need to risk $105 in order to win $100. So, for example, if the Canucks are listed as a -105 favourite against the Flames, this means that you would need to bet $105 on the Canucks in order to win $100 if they win the game.

The next type of NHL betting odds we'll discuss is -125. This is also referred to as "Decimal Odds" and means that you need to risk 1.25 units in order to win 1 unit. So, for example, if the Canucks are listed as a -125 favourite against the Flames, this means that you would need to bet 1.25 units on the Canucks in order to win 1 unit if they win the game.

The last type of NHL betting odds we'll discuss is -135. This is also referred to as "Fractional Odds" and means that you need to risk Â£135 in order to win Â£100. So, for example, if the Canucks are listed as a -135 favourite against the Flames, this means that you would need to bet Â£135 on the Canucks in order for them lose for them lose £100 (your original stake).

#  NBA Playoffs Betting: What Does -135 Mean?

When you see a basketball game with a point spread of -135, it means that one team is favored to win by 7 points. So, for example, if the Lakers were playing the Pacers, and the line read LAL -135, that would mean that most people think the Lakers will beat the Pacers by 7 points or more. Indy would then be considered an underdog at +115 (meaning you’d make $115 on a $100 bet).

Basketball betting lines are determined by Vegas oddsmakers, who use a variety of factors to come up with their numbers. In this case, they’re likely factoring in the fact that the Lakers are at home, as well as their overall record and recent form. The Pacers, on the other hand, are coming off a loss and may not be as heavily favored.

If you’re thinking about betting on this game, understanding what -135 means can help you make a more informed decision. Keep in mind that there’s no sure thing when it comes to sports betting, but making smart choices can increase your chances of winning.

#  MLB Playoffs Betting: What Does -135 Mean?

In the world of sports betting, there are a number of different ways to bet on a game. You can bet on who will win, how many points will be scored, and more. One of the most popular bets is the moneyline bet.

With a moneyline bet, you're simply betting on which team will win the game. There is no point spread, so the team that wins outright is the winner. Moneyline bets come in two different formats - positive and negative.

A positive moneyline means that the team is expected to win by more than the point spread. For example, if a team has a moneyline of +150, that means they're expected to win by three or more points. A negative moneyline indicates that the team is expected to lose by more than the point spread. For example, if a team has a moneyline of -135, that means they're expected to lose by 3 1/2 points or more.

When making a moneyline bet, you simply need to choose which side you think will win. If you think Team A will beat Team B by more than the point spread set by the Sportsbook, then you would bet on Team A with a positive moneyline. If you think Team B will beat Team A by more than the point spread, then you would bet on Team B with a negative moneyline

#  NFL PlayoffsBetting: What Does -135 Mean? 

In NFL Playoffs betting, the favorite team is typically represented with a minus sign (-) and the underdog has a plus sign (+). So if you want to bet on the favorite, you must wager $135 to win $100. If you want to bet on the underdog, then you would risk only $100 to win $135. 

A -135 price means that a gambler would have to risk $135 to win $100. This is also known as "juice" or vigorish. It's important to understand this concept because it will affect how much money you stand to win or lose on any given wager. 

For example, let's say you placed a $10 bet on the favorite in a game with a -135 line. If your team wins, your payout would be $14.29 (your original bet plus your stake multiplied by the odds). But if the team loses, you would lose your entire $10 stake. 

Conversely, if you placed a $10 bet on an underdog with a +135 line, your payout would be $17.24 if your team won (again, your original bet plus your stake multiplied by the odds). If the team lost, you would only lose your original $10 bet. 

So while betting on the favorite offers less potential upside, it also carries less risk if things don't go your way. And vice versa for betting on the underdog. 

# What Do Point Spreads Mean in NFL Playoff Betting?
On top of moneylines, most sportsbooks also offer point spreads for NFL playoff games. A point spread assigns a certain number of points to one team and leaves the other side at zero points. So for example, in a game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Atlanta Falcons with a spread of 7 points, Philly would be favored by 7 points. If they won by 8 or more points, then anyone who bet on them would win; conversely if they only won by 7 points then anyone who bet against them would win their bets instead. 
The purpose of point spreads is to try and even out the chances of both teams winning so that there's more action (and thus more money) taken on both sides of the book. This makes it more difficult for any one person to clean up by picking winners exclusively. 
# How Does In-Play Betting Work for NFL Playoffs?
In-Play betting (or "Live betting") allows gamblers to place bets on games as they are happening rather than waiting until all games are completed and final scores are tallied up. This can be done at most sportsbooks either through their website or mobile app. 
For NFL playoff games in particular, in-play betting can be especially exciting because there tends to be lots of momentum swings and back-and-forth scoring throughout each game. So if you feel confident about how things are going early on in a game but start having second thoughts later on, In-Play betting allows you to make changes to your bets accordingly without having to wait until the end of the game.

#  NCAA Football Betting: What Does -135 Mean?

When looking at NCAA football betting lines, you will see a variety of different numbers next to the team's name. One of the most common is -135. This number is known as the point spread and it is used to determine how likely each team is to win the game.

In order to understand what this number means, you first need to understand how sports betting works. Bettors will wager on who they think will win the game. In addition, they can also wager on how many points they think the winning team will win by. For example, if Alabama is playing Tennessee and the point spread is -7, that means that Alabama is favored to win by 7 points. If someone bets on Alabama, they will have to bet $135 to win $100. On the other hand, if someone bets on Tennessee, they will only have to bet $100 to win $135.

The number next to the point spread (-7 in this case) is known as the odds or vigorish. This number represents the percentage that the bookmaker (or casino) takes from the losing side of each bet. So in our example, for every $100 wagered on Alabama winning by more than 7 points, the bookmaker would keep $7 (or 7%). For every $100 wagered on Tennessee winning or losing by less than 7 points, the bookmaker would keep $10 (or 10%).
