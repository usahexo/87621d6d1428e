#  Nevada Becomes the New Casino Royalty 

In what can only be called a smashing victory for Nevada, the state has just made it legal for casinos to offer live dealer games. This new development is expected to breathe new life into the casino industry in Nevada and is already being hailed as a major coup by casino operators in the state.

According to industry experts, live dealer games are becoming increasingly popular with casino players. This is due to the fact that they offer an authentic casino experience that can’t be found at online casinos. Players are able to interact with real dealers and other players in a social setting, which makes for a more immersive gaming experience.

With this new development, Nevada is poised to become the new casino royalty. Casino operators in the state are already gearing up to offer live dealer games and are expecting high demand from players. In addition, they are expecting the addition of live dealer games to help them stay competitive with other states that have legalized online gambling.

It will be interesting to see how the addition of live dealer games affects the casino industry in Nevada. Stay tuned for updates!

#  Pennsylvania Opens First Slot Parlor Amid Gambling Debate 

Pennsylvania has finally opened its first slot parlor, amid a raging debate about gambling in the state. The $120 million Hollywood Casino in Penn National Race Course near Harrisburg became operational on Wednesday, offering more than 1,000 slot machines and electronic table games.

Supporters of gambling argue that it is a necessary source of revenue for the cash-strapped state. Opponents, however, say that gambling destroys lives and families. Pennsylvania is one of only six states that does not have some form of casino gambling.

The opening of the Hollywood Casino comes as the state legislature is considering a bill that would allow construction of up to 40 new casinos. The measure is expected to generate $1.3 billion in new tax revenue per year.

Governor Tom Corbett has come out in favor of the bill, saying that it would create jobs and help to rescue the state's struggling economy. Critics say that the bill is being pushed through without enough scrutiny.

#  West Virginia Casinos See Record Profits in 2017 

West Virginia casinos continue to see record profits, as the industry has now topped the $1 billion mark in annual revenue for the first time.

According to figures released by the West Virginia Lottery Commission, the state’s casinos took in more than $1.08 billion in revenue in 2017, up from over $994 million in 2016. The increase was due in part to the opening of a new casino, Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, last year.

In addition to Hollywood Casino, there are six other licensed casinos in West Virginia: The Greenbrier Casino & Resort, Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack & Resort, Wheeling Island Hotel-Casino-Racetrack, Mardi Gras Casino & Resort, and Cross Lanes Casino.

The growth in gambling revenues is good news for the state, as it helps to fund important programs like education and Medicaid. In fact, since 2009 gambling revenue has contributed nearly $2.5 billion to the state’s general fund.

While some may worry that casino expansion could lead to addiction and other social problems, recent studies have shown that casino gambling is actually responsible for less crime than other forms of entertainment. For example, a study published by the University of Nevada found that “crime rates are significantly lower in counties with casinos than those without them.”

So if you’re looking for a fun and safe way to spend an evening or weekend, West Virginia casinos are definitely worth checking out!

#  Maryland Committee Advances Bill to Allow Table Games at Casinos 

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — A Maryland House committee has advanced a bill that would allow table games like roulette and blackjack at casinos in the state.

The chairwoman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Del. Sheila Hixson, said Thursday that the proposal would generate about $200 million in revenue for the state over two years. The committee voted 15-9 to send the bill to the floor of the House of Delegates.

Supporters say table games would create jobs and help keep Maryland casinos competitive against casinos in neighboring states.

Opponents argue that the proposal could lead to increased crime and gambling addiction.

Hixson says her committee made some amendments to the bill in an effort to address some of those concerns, including requiring training for casino employees who deal with table games.

#  Rhode Island's Twin River Casino to Add Gambling Tables

The Twin River Casino in Lincoln, Rhode Island is set to add slot machines and gambling tables as the casino looks to renew its license from the state.

According to WPRI-TV, the changes will also include a new gaming area and an upgraded rewards program.

The move is part of a $40 million renovation project at the casino, which is owned by the Twin River Management Group.

The casino has been granted a provisional license by the Rhode Island Gaming Commission, which will allow it to add the new gambling tables. The commission says it will continue to monitor the casino's performance.
