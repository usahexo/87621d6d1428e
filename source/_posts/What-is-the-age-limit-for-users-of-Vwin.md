In addition, users have the ability to opt out of cookies at any time. Finally, Vwin does not sell or disclose any user data to third-party organisations.

#  Is there a way to deactivate automatic updates?

Yes, there is a way to deactivate automatic updates on Windows 10. You can either use the Group Policy Editor or registry settings.

To use the Group Policy Editor, go to Start > type “gpedit.msc” (without quotes) and hit Enter. Then navigate to:

Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update

There you will find the policy “Do not allow update deferral policies to cause updates to be installed automatically”. Double-click on it and set it to Enabled.

If you want to use the registry instead, then go to:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate

There create a new DWORD (32-bit) value called “AUOptions” and set it to 2 (this will disable automatic updates).
