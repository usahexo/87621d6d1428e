#  Final Fantasy 14: What Exactly Do I Need To Open The Level 50 Roulette?

Themed around the release of Stormblood, Square Enix has implemented a new level 50 roulette in Final Fantasy 14. The roulette is accessible by players who have reached level 50 and completed the story quests for Heavensward. Completing these prerequisites, however, doesn't automatically mean you can start spinning the wheel - there's still a few things you need to do first.

In this article, we'll take a look at everything you need to do in order to unlock the level 50 roulette in Final Fantasy 14: Stormblood.

# Meet the Requirements

First and foremost, you'll need to meet certain requirements before being able to access the level 50 roulette in FFXIV: Stormblood. The most important one is that you must be level 50 or above - if you're not quite there yet, then we suggest grinding through those last few levels as fast as possible!

The other prerequisite is that you must have completed the main story quests for Heavensward. This means finishing up everything up to and including "The Warrior of Light Rises" - after that, simply speak with Garlond Ironworks engineer Gerolt and he'll initiate the next set of tasks required to open up the level 50 roulette.

# Talk to Allied Grand Company NPCs

After completing the Heavensward main story quests and reaching level 50 or above, speak with either an Aquapolis search member or union representative for your respective Grand Company. They will give you a quest titled "Allied Grand Company." Players who have already progressed far enough in their Ala Mhigan storyline will already have this quest - if you've completed it, then skip ahead to step four!

This quest tasks players with traveling around Eorzea and gathering signature items from enemies associated with each Grand Company. Once all three items have been obtained, return them to your respective Allied Grand Company NPC for a reward and permission to enter their respective training Grounds. It's worth noting that even if you've already obtained these items (i.e., finished "Allied Grand Company"), simply talking to an Allied NPC will trigger the aforementioned quest so long as your character is level 50 or above.
































Ivalice is on fire! After hearing about how dangerous things had gotten from some of his fellow Lalafellin tourists at Costa del Sol—and getting lost on more than one occasion while trying to find his way back—the young Midlander resolved himself finally to doing something about it: He’d become a sky pirate! Following a few pointers from some passing sailors (and more than a little bit of eavesdropping), he sets out for Limsa Lominsa in search of adventure and fortune . . .  joining up with an aspiring pirate crew along the way!  How does this sound? You don’t just play as any old boring Midlander though; no siree! You get to create your very own self-customized character right down to eye color and hairstyle!  So what are you waiting for? The seas are calling! But first…a little backstory on Ivalice:  When it comes down to it, Ivalice has always been kinda like Final Fantasy XV’s Rogue Region—wild, dangerous, lawless frontier country ripe for exploration (albeit FF15’s world map is considerably smaller). It’s home not only to gritty sky pirates but also all manner of beasts and monsters that roam its untamed landscapes; sometimes it seems like there’s nothing more profitable for enterprising adventurers than taking on jobs involving exterminating whatever happens pop up wherever they go. For our intrepid Midlander friend-to-be though, such prospects are just fine by him; he’s got plenty of gumption (guts?) and he isn’t afraid of a fight . . . especially now that he has himself a trusty cutlass and pistol! But enough about our would-be swashbuckler—let’s get on with making him/her!

#  How To Play The Level 50 Roulette In Final Fantasy 14

The Level 50 roulette is a game in the casino in Final Fantasy XIV. The game is simple- you roll a die and get a number. If that number corresponds to one of the six numbers on your roulette board, then you win!

There are a few things to keep in mind when playing this game. First, the payout is not very good- you only stand to win 400 gil per roll. Second, the odds of winning are not great either- there is only a 1 in 6 chance of winning on any given roll.

With that said, there are a few ways to improve your odds of winning. One is to wait until you have a full set of six numbers before playing. This will give you a 1 in 36 chance of winning, which is much better than the 1 in 6 chance you get when playing with random numbers.

Another way to improve your odds is to use lucky dice. These special dice can be purchased from the casino dealer for 1000 gil apiece. They come with two different bonus effects- one that increases your odds of winning and one that decreases your odds of losing.

Using lucky dice can be a great way to boost your chances of winning at the Level 50 roulette game. However, it's important to remember that they are not guaranteed to work every time, so don't bet too much money on them!

#  What Rewards Can Be Obtained From The Level 50 Roulette In Final Fantasy 14

Rewards in the level 50 roulette are plentiful and varied, making it a popular destination for endgame players. Among the rewards are some of the best items and equipment in the game, as well as materials necessary for crafting high-level gear.

The level 50 roulette can be accessed by speaking to the NPC located in the Dravanian Hinterlands at X:20.8 Y:11.5. There are three different reward wheels available, each with different rewards. The first wheel offers weapons and armor, the second offers crafting materials and food ingredients, and the third offers minions and mounts.

Of particular interest to many players is the third wheel, which offers a number of powerful minions and mounts. These include the unicorn mount, Behemoth minion, and Adamantoise mount. Each of these can be extremely valuable for players looking to improve their character's performance in endgame content.

In addition to powerful minions and mounts, players can also acquire high-level weapons and armor from the level 50 roulette. One of the best items that can be obtained is the Doman longbow, which offers a massive amount of damage potential for archers at level 50+. Other powerful weapons that can be obtained include the Gae Bolg sword and Genji gloves.

Players looking to improve their gear should definitely consider spending some time in the level 50 roulette. With so many powerful rewards available, it's a great destination for players seeking to take their characters to new heights.
