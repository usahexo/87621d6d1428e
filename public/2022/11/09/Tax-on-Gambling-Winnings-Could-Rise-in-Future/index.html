      Tax on Gambling Winnings Could Rise in Future

<p>The government is thought to be considering a rise in the amount of tax that is paid on gambling winnings, from the current rate of 20%, to as much as 45%. This would equate to an extra £900 being paid on £2000 of winnings, and could net the treasury millions of pounds each year.</p>
<p>The news was revealed by Treasury Minister Mel Stride, in comments made to The Sunday Times. Stride said that the government is “considering increasing the rate of duty (tax) on gaming machines and on winning bets from 20% to 25% and then up to 45%”.</p>
<p>This move would likely be popular with many people who feel that gamblers have been getting off lightly when it comes to tax, but it is likely to lead to a decline in gambling revenues. This could have a knock-on effect on businesses which rely on gambling revenue, such as bookmakers and casinos.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear when any changes might come into force, but it seems likely that they will be announced in next month’s budget.</p>
<h1 id="Taxman-Set-to-Benefit-from-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Taxman-Set-to-Benefit-from-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Taxman Set to Benefit from Gambling Winnings"></a>Taxman Set to Benefit from Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The government is planning to increase its tax revenue from gambling after new figures show that the Treasury’s take from the industry has increased by almost a tenth in the past year.</p>
<p>The Gambling Commission’s latest figures show that the total gambling duty paid to the government was £2.17bn in 2018-19, up from £1.98bn in 2017-18. This equates to an increase of 9.8%.</p>
<p>An analysis of the data by accounting firm UHY Hacker Young found that casino gaming duty was the biggest contributor, making up almost half of the total (48%). Remote gaming duty, paid on profits generated by online casinos and bookmakers, was the next largest contributor (32%), followed by betting duty (15%) and pool betting duty (5%).</p>
<p>John O’Connell, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “It is good news that gambling tax revenue is on the rise, but taxpayers will be keen to ensure that this money is used to benefit them rather than lining the pockets of bureaucrats or being wasted on pet projects.</p>
<p>“Government must be transparent about how this extra money is being spent and what it is being used for. Too often we see headline grabbing investments which are later quietly abandoned, leaving taxpayers out of pocket. We need clarity on where this extra cash is going so taxpayers can be sure their hard earned money is being put to good use.”</p>
<p>A Treasury spokesperson said: “This increase in gambling taxes shows that our world-leading regulations are working and that we are getting more money for schools and hospitals from those who enjoy gambling products. We will continue to make sure that those who profit from gambling pay their fair share.”</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Winnings-to-be-Taxed-at-Higher-Rate"><a href="#Gambling-Winnings-to-be-Taxed-at-Higher-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Winnings to be Taxed at Higher Rate"></a>Gambling Winnings to be Taxed at Higher Rate</h1><p>The government is looking to increase the tax rate on gambling winnings in the upcoming budget. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said that the government is planning to increase the tax rate from its current level of 15 percent to as high as 50 percent.</p>
<p>Morneau made the comments during a meeting with reporters, saying that the new tax rate would apply to all gambling winnings, including those from lotteries, casinos and online betting. He added that the higher tax rates were needed to ensure that the wealthy are paying their fair share.</p>
<p>The government has been under pressure to increase taxes on the wealthy since it revealed its plan for budgetary reform last month. The proposed changes include raising the income tax rate for those earning more than $200,000 per year and introducing a new surtax on those earning more than $1 million.</p>
<p>The proposal for higher taxes on gambling winnings has been met with mixed reactions. Some people argue that it is unfair to tax lottery winners at a higher rate than those who earn their money through other means. Others say that the move is necessary to ensure that everyone is paying their fair share.</p>
<p>The budget is expected to be released in March, and it will be up to Parliament to decide whether or not to adopt the proposed changes.</p>
<h1 id="Government-to-Tighten-Grip-on-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Government-to-Tighten-Grip-on-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Government to Tighten Grip on Gambling Winnings"></a>Government to Tighten Grip on Gambling Winnings</h1><p>Ahead of the next election, the government has announced that it plans to tighten regulations on gambling winnings, in an attempt to prevent excessive amounts of money from being funnelled into the gambling industry.</p>
<p>The exact details of the new regulations have not yet been finalised, but it is understood that they will involve a cap on the amount of money that can be won from gambling. This cap is expected to be set at a lower level than the current limit on personal income tax allowances, meaning that individuals will be able to keep only a limited proportion of their winnings.</p>
<p>The government is also considering implementing a new tax on gambling winnings, which would be charged at a rate of 20-30%. This would ensure that the government received a share of any money that was won from gambling, and would help to offset the cost of any potential compensation payouts that may be required as a result of the new regulations.</p>
<p>The announcement has been met with mixed reactions from the public. Some people feel that the government is going too far in its efforts to crackdown on gambling, while others argue that more needs to be done to protect vulnerable people from being exploited by the industry.</p>
<p>One thing that is clear is that the proposed changes will have a significant impact on how much money people can win from gambling. If they are implemented, then it is likely that many people will choose to gamble elsewhere, where they can enjoy greater freedom and flexibility when it comes to winning money.</p>
<h1 id="HMRC-to-Receive-Increased-Revenue-from-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#HMRC-to-Receive-Increased-Revenue-from-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="HMRC to Receive Increased Revenue from Gambling Winnings"></a>HMRC to Receive Increased Revenue from Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The Treasury has announced that the Government is to receive increased revenue from gambling winnings in the next financial year. The move, which comes as part of the Government’s efforts to bolster the public finances, is expected to raise an additional £500 million in taxes.</p>
<p>The increase will see the amount of tax paid on gambling profits rise from 15% to 25%. The new rate will apply to all forms of gambling, including online and high street betting shops.</p>
<p>The Treasury said that the extra money would be used to help reduce the country’s budget deficit. Chancellor Philip Hammond said: “This rise in tax will help us reduce the deficit and protect public services. It is part of our plan to make Britain a country that works for everyone.”</p>
<p>The move has been welcomed by the gambling industry, with Betfred boss Fred Done saying: “This is a great day for bookmakers and good news for customers who should now see better prices and more innovation as a result of increased competition.”</p>
<p>However, anti-gambling campaigners have criticised the move, arguing that it will fuel addiction and crime. Labour MP Carolyn Harris said: “This is a licence to print money for bookmakers and a disaster for problem gamblers and their families. The government must think again about this decision which will only make things worse for those struggling with addiction.”</p>
