        <h1 id="Major-On-line-Casino-Gambling-Provider-DraftKings-Adds-Bitcoin-Payments"><a href="#Major-On-line-Casino-Gambling-Provider-DraftKings-Adds-Bitcoin-Payments" class="headerlink" title="Major On-line Casino Gambling Provider DraftKings Adds Bitcoin Payments"></a>Major On-line Casino Gambling Provider DraftKings Adds Bitcoin Payments</h1><p>Major on-line casino gambling provider DraftKings has announced that it is now accepting Bitcoin payments.</p>
<p>This means that players can now use the cryptocurrency to make deposits and withdrawals at the site.</p>
<p>In a statement, DraftKings said: “After careful consideration, we have decided to add Bitcoin as a payment option for our players. This will allow us to continue growing our business globally and provide our customers with the best possible experience.”</p>
<p>The move is likely to be welcomed by Bitcoin users, who will now be able to use the currency to gamble on-line without having to convert it into traditional currency.</p>
<p>DraftKings is not the first on-line casino to accept Bitcoin payments – both PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker have been doing so for some time. However, being a major player in the industry, DraftKings’ adoption of Bitcoin is significant news.</p>
<p>It is also another boost for Bitcoin, which has seen its value increase substantially in recent months. At the beginning of 2017, one Bitcoin was worth around $1,000 – it is now worth over $6,000.</p>
<h1 id="US-On-line-Gambling-Firm-DraftKings-Secures-250-Million-In-Funding"><a href="#US-On-line-Gambling-Firm-DraftKings-Secures-250-Million-In-Funding" class="headerlink" title="US On-line Gambling Firm DraftKings Secures $250 Million In Funding"></a>US On-line Gambling Firm DraftKings Secures $250 Million In Funding</h1><p>DraftKings, a US on-line gambling firm, has secured $250 million in funding from investors. This included a $150 million investment from Fox Sports, the Rupert Murdoch-owned media conglomerate.</p>
<p>The company is one of several start-ups looking to capitalize on the legalization of online gambling in the United States. A number of states have moved to legalize various forms of online gambling in recent years, including New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware.</p>
<p>DraftKings allows customers to bet on a range of sports activities, including American football, baseball, basketball and ice hockey. The company has said that it plans to use the new funding to expand its operations into new states.</p>
<p>“With this investment we are well positioned for explosive growth in 2015 and beyond as we continue to bring our product to more states,” said Jason Robins, CEO and co-founder of DraftKings.</p>
<p>Fox Sports’ investment in DraftKings comes at a time when the media company is looking to expand its portfolio of digital businesses. In addition to its majority stake in DraftKings, Fox Sports also owns stakes in several other online ventures, including the social media network Vine and the fantasy football website Scout Gaming.</p>
<h1 id="Gibraltar’s-Gaming-Commission-Grants-Online-Gambling-License-To-DraftKings"><a href="#Gibraltar’s-Gaming-Commission-Grants-Online-Gambling-License-To-DraftKings" class="headerlink" title="Gibraltar’s Gaming Commission Grants Online Gambling License To DraftKings"></a>Gibraltar’s Gaming Commission Grants Online Gambling License To DraftKings</h1><p>Gibraltar’s Gaming Commission has recently granted an online gambling license to the daily fantasy sports site, DraftKings. This is great news for the site, as it now has a stamp of approval from a reputable licensing authority. The license will allow DraftKings to offer its services to customers in Gibraltar and throughout Europe.</p>
<p>DraftKings is one of the leading fantasy sports sites in the world, with over 8 million registered users. The company is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, and was founded in 2012. It offers a variety of contests for different sports, including NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and college football and basketball.</p>
<p>The granting of the online gambling license is another positive development for DraftKings, which has been facing scrutiny in recent months. In October 2015, it was revealed that employees of the company had been using inside information to win money in rival contests. This led to investigations by several state attorneys general, as well as the FBI.</p>
<p>Despite these troubles, DraftKings appears to be moving forward with its plans to expand into new markets. The company has already launched a Spanish-language site aimed at the Latin American market. With a newly approved gambling license in hand, it looks like DraftKings is poised for further growth in 2016 and beyond.</p>
<h1 id="UKGC-Grants-License-For-Online-Gambling-Operation-To-US-Firm-DraftKings"><a href="#UKGC-Grants-License-For-Online-Gambling-Operation-To-US-Firm-DraftKings" class="headerlink" title="UKGC Grants License For Online Gambling Operation To US Firm DraftKings"></a>UKGC Grants License For Online Gambling Operation To US Firm DraftKings</h1><p>The United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) has reportedly granted a license for online gambling operations to US-based firm DraftKings. The move comes as the UKGC looks to expand its licensing program to include more operators in order to better protect UK consumers.</p>
<p>According to a report from Reuters, the UKGC granted the license to DraftKings on Monday, making it the first US-based firm to receive a license from the regulatory body. The move is seen as a positive for DraftKings, which has been working to expand its presence in Europe after receiving a license from Ireland’s gambling regulator last year.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the UKGC told Reuters that the commission is looking to expand its licensing program in order to “protect consumers and ensure that all operators are fit and proper.” The spokesman added that the commission will continue to work with other regulators in order to “maximize protections” for consumers.</p>
<p>For DraftKings, the license from the UKGC is another step in its efforts to establish itself as a leading player in the global online gambling market. The company has been seeking licenses from regulators around the world as it looks to build out its offering beyond its home market of the United States.</p>
<p>In a statement, DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said that obtaining a license from the UKGC is an important step for the company. “This licence is another important milestone as we work towards our goal of becoming one of the world’s leading online gambling platforms,” Robins said.</p>
<p>The news comes as regulators around the world are increasingly looking at how they can best protect consumers in an age where online gambling is becoming increasingly popular. In recent years, several scandals have rocked the online gambling industry, including revelations that employees at some firms had been using insider information to win bets.</p>
<p>Regulators have responded to these scandals by increasing their scrutiny of online gambling firms. This has led many firms operating in Europe and other regions outside of their home markets to seek licenses from local regulators in order to ensure compliance with strict regulations.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Online-Gambling-Firm-DraftKings-Gets-Social-Gaming-License"><a href="#New-Jersey-Online-Gambling-Firm-DraftKings-Gets-Social-Gaming-License" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Online Gambling Firm DraftKings Gets Social Gaming License"></a>New Jersey Online Gambling Firm DraftKings Gets Social Gaming License</h1><p>New Jersey regulators have given online gambling firm DraftKings a social gaming license, which will allow the company to offer its services to residents in the state.</p>
<p>The company is one of the first in the US to be awarded a social gaming license and it plans to use the authorization to offer a new product that will combine elements of sports betting and fantasy sports.</p>
<p>The product, which is set to launch in the coming weeks, will allow users to make wagers on sporting events while also competing against friends in contests.</p>
<p>“We are excited for this next chapter in our history as we continue to lead the industry in innovation,” said DraftKings CEO Jason Robins.</p>
<p>The move comes as DraftKings looks to expand its operations following a decision by the US Supreme Court earlier this year that struck down a federal law prohibiting most states from legalizing sports betting.</p>
