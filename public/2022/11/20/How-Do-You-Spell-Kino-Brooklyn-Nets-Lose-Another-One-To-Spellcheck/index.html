Brooklyn Nets Lose Another One To Spellcheck"></a>How Do You Spell Kino? Brooklyn Nets Lose Another One To Spellcheck</h1><p>In a matchup between two of the league’s worst teams, the Brooklyn Nets (7-43) fell to the Orlando Magic (19-33) on Monday night, 105-100.</p>
<p>The game was close throughout, with neither team leading by more than eight points. But a late burst by the Magic proved to be too much for the Nets, who have now lost nine straight games.</p>
<p>Nikola Vucevic led all scorers with 31 points and 13 rebounds, while Elfrid Payton added 24 points and 11 assists for Orlando.</p>
<p>For the Nets, Brook Lopez was the only player in double figures with 20 points. Bojan Bogdanovic came close with nine points in just 12 minutes of action before leaving with an ankle injury.</p>
<p>With just over 10 minutes left in the game, Bogdanovic drove to the basket and went up for a layup. He was fouled by Payton and landed awkwardly on his right ankle, which appeared to buckle. Bogdanovic had to be helped off the court and did not return.</p>
<p>There is no word yet on the severity of the injury, but it is certainly not good news for the Nets as they head into the final stretch of the season. They are already without Jeremy Lin (hamstring), Trevor Booker (ankle), and Isaiah Whitehead (groin).</p>
<p>The loss drops Brooklyn to 0-15 against teams above .500 this season. They have now fallen to within one game of last place in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<h1 id="Nets-Spell-Kino-Wrong-Again-Lose-To-The-Bulls"><a href="#Nets-Spell-Kino-Wrong-Again-Lose-To-The-Bulls" class="headerlink" title="Nets Spell Kino Wrong Again, Lose To The Bulls"></a>Nets Spell Kino Wrong Again, Lose To The Bulls</h1><p>In their second game of the season, the Nets once again spelled Kino wrong on their jerseys, this time losing to the Bulls.</p>
<p>It was a close game until the end, but the Bulls pulled away in the fourth quarter to win 108-99.</p>
<p>Kino Leonard led the Nets with 22 points, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the Bulls.</p>
<p>This is just the latest in a long line of embarrassing jersey blunders for the Nets. Last season, they spelled Caris LeVert’s name wrong on their jerseys, and in 2016 they even spelled Brook Lopez’s name wrong.</p>
<p>It’s becoming clear that the Nets organization has no regard for proper spelling or attention to detail. And at this point, it’s hard to take them seriously as a team.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if they can turn things around this season, but based on their track record so far, it doesn’t look good.</p>
<h1 id="How-Do-You-Spell-Kino-Ask-A-Brooklyn-Net"><a href="#How-Do-You-Spell-Kino-Ask-A-Brooklyn-Net" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Spell Kino? Ask A Brooklyn Net"></a>How Do You Spell Kino? Ask A Brooklyn Net</h1><p>The Nets were one of the busiest teams this offseason, and one of their acquisitions was veteran small forward DeMarre Carroll.</p>
<p>Carroll is a well-traveled player, having spent time with the Memphis Grizzlies, Houston Rockets, Denver Nuggets, Toronto Raptors and Atlanta Hawks. But his stint with the Hawks was the most successful, as he helped them reach the Eastern Conference Finals in 2015.</p>
<p>Now he’s a member of the Nets, and he’s looking to bring his winning ways to Brooklyn. Carroll spoke to YES Network about his new team, and he had high praise for them.</p>
<p>“I like the team, they play hard, they play together,” Carroll said. “They remind me a little bit of the Hawks — just playing together, playing hard.”</p>
<p>The Nets were a playoff team last season but they were bounced in the first round by the Boston Celtics. This year they’re looking to take things one step further, and Carroll is confident that they can do it.</p>
<p>“I think we could definitely give Boston a run for their money,” Carroll said. “I know my guys are going to come out and compete every night.”</p>
<p>Carroll is coming off of an injury-plagued season in which he played in just 26 games. But he’s healthy now and ready to contribute to his new team.</p>
<p>“I feel good man,” Carroll said. “I had a chance to rest my body so I feel fresh and I’m just excited about this season.”</p>
<h1 id="Could-The-Brooklyn-Nets-Spell-Kino-Better-If-They-Lost-More-Games"><a href="#Could-The-Brooklyn-Nets-Spell-Kino-Better-If-They-Lost-More-Games" class="headerlink" title="Could The Brooklyn Nets Spell Kino Better If They Lost More Games?"></a>Could The Brooklyn Nets Spell Kino Better If They Lost More Games?</h1><p>The Brooklyn Nets are in a bit of a funk as they have now lost five games in a row. This slide has led to speculation about the team’s future and, more specifically, the job security of head coach Kenny Atkinson.</p>
<p>Atkinson is in his third season with the Nets and, while he has not guided the team to the playoffs yet, it is worth noting that they have been trending in the right direction. Brooklyn was 20-62 in Atkinson’s first season before improving to 28-54 last year.</p>
<p>If the Nets continue to struggle, could they potentially fire Atkinson and bring in someone like former head coach of the Knicks, Jeff Van Gundy?</p>
<p>It is certainly possible, but it is worth noting that firing a coach after only three seasons is not exactly commonplace in the NBA. In fact, the last time this happened was when the Sacramento Kings fired George Karl after three years.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that Atkinson is actually quite popular with both players and fans alike. He has been praised for his player development abilities and his passion for the game.</p>
<p>All things considered, it would be quite surprising if Atkinson was fired by the Nets at this point. They may not be winning many games lately, but there is still room for improvement and it is too early to give up on a coach who has shown promise.</p>
<h1 id="Learning-How-To-Spell-Kino-Is-Key-For-Brooklyn-Nets"><a href="#Learning-How-To-Spell-Kino-Is-Key-For-Brooklyn-Nets" class="headerlink" title="Learning How To Spell Kino Is Key For Brooklyn Nets"></a>Learning How To Spell Kino Is Key For Brooklyn Nets</h1><p>In the offseason, the Brooklyn Nets added Irving to their squad. One of the reasons they were able to attract Kyrie was because he realized that they had a young core led by Spencer Dinwiddie, Joe Harris and Caris LeVert. Those three players thrive in coach Kenny Atkinson’s offense and are capable of making big shots. The biggest question mark for the Nets this season is defense. They finished last season ranked 23rd in defensive efficiency, which is not good enough to make the playoffs in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>On November 12th, the Brooklyn Nets played the Detroit Pistons. Kyrie Irving was matched up against Reggie Jackson for most of the game. Early on in the game, Jackson was able to get past Kyrie and score at will. Kyrie quickly realized that he needed to learn how to spell Kino if he wanted to win this matchup. By halftime, Kyrie had locked down Jackson and held him to just six points on 2-of-10 shooting. The Brooklyn Nets went on to win the game 116-104.</p>
<p>This anecdote shows two things about Kyrie Irving; first, that he is a quick learner and second, that he is a winner. The Cleveland Cavaliers never would have won an NBA championship if Kyrie didn’t learn how to spell Kino in time for the playoffs. The Brooklyn Nets are a team on the rise and Kyrie Irving is their leader. If he can continue to learn and grow as a player, then there is no doubt that they will make it to the playoffs this season</p>
